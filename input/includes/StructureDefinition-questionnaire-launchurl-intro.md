Questionnaire resources describe assessment instruments that can be performed by software
programs or via a web interface.  The Questionnaire Launch extension allows for one
or more urls to be reported in a Questionnaire resource that would allow it to be executed
by an external service.  This extension supplies the Launch URL for a SMART on FHIR
EHR Launch or Standalone Launch sequence.
