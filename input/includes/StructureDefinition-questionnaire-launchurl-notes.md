## Security Considerations
A Launch URL provides access to computing resources outside of the control of the application
or organization using it.  Applications using a launch URL to access services which
capture sensitive patient information should take care to verify that these URLs point
to trusted sites that an organization considers to be safe to work with.  Implementers
should consider very carefully how they take advantage of this capability, for example,
by allowing Launch URLs to be accessed only via filtering using organizationally
controlled white lists.
