IHE Assessment Curation and Data Collection 
===========================================

The IHE Assessment Curation and Data Collection (ACDC) profile supports the selection
of assessment instruments from a repository and the integration of those instruments
into a provider workflow for the capture of assessment data for a given patient.

This implementation guide provides the FHIR Implementation materials associated with
this IHE profile.  This guide includes content from the IHE ACDC Profile Supplement,
however, the IHE published PDF content for this supplement is considered to be the
normative content.

The output of the FHIR Continuous Integration build is published [at build.fhir.org](http://build.fhir.org/ig/IHE/ACDC/branches/master/index.html).
